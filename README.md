reating an App
You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.
To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:
npx
npx create-react-app my-app
(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)
npm
npm init react-app my-app
npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+
Yarn
yarn create react-app my-app
yarn create <starter-kit-package> is available in Yarn 0.25+
It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:
cdmy-app
Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:
npm start or yarn start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
npm test or yarn test
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
Read more about testing.
npm run build or yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed.
